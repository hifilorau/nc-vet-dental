         How do I know if my pet's mouth is painful?
         <span class="accordion-item-arrow"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
         This is the most common question owners ask. Since animals cannot tell us if they hurt, we must try to equate dental problems in pets with similar dental problems in humans. For example, a person with an abscessed tooth may tell you it hurts, but not enough for them to stop eating or going on with normal every day life. For the most part, this is the case with animals that have diseased teeth and/or gums. Owners rarely report loss of appetite or lethargy when their pet has dental disease. After the pet's teeth have been treated, however, we often have owners report an increase in play/fetch activity with chew or tug toys, indicating that there had been some level of discomfort.

         Why are dental radiographs always needed?
         <span class="accordion-item-arrow"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
     <p>Dental x-rays help us evaluate the entire tooth structure and surrounding bone. </p>

    <p>Since oral disease does not stop at the gumline, intraoral radiographs of the root structure and surrounding bone are imperative to diagnose disease and develop a treatment plan for oral disease in pets. Without the use of dental radiographs, we are prevented from seeing two-thirds of the tooth structure. There are many indications for dental radiographs including the following: red or swollen gums, bleeding gums, broken teeth, missing teeth, resorptive lesions, loose teeth, abnormal periodontal pocket depth around teeth, worn teeth, and discolored teeth.</p> </div>

         Do I need a referral from my family veterinarian?
         <span class="accordion-item-arrow"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
         Although most patients are referred directly by their family veterinarian; it is not required. Your family veterinarian plays critical role in your petâ€™s overall health. The staff at Westside will work with you to insure that all the necessary information is received from your family veterinarian prior to your appointment time. We also have a strong commitment to commuinicating all examination findings and treatments to your regular veterinarian the same day of the visit. </div>

         What type of pre-operative screening in needed prior to my appointment?
         <span class="accordion-item-arrow"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        For all patients a recent veterinary examination, full chemistry panel, complete blood count and urinalysis are needed. For cats older then 8 years of age, a thyroid level is also needed. In addition, patients at risk for hypertension should have blood pressure measurements obtained. If patients have had a history of unexplained weight loss, then chest radiographs and abdominal ultrasound may be recommended prior to anesthesia. </div>

         Will my pet need to stay overnight?
         <span class="accordion-item-arrow"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
       No. We send all patients home the same day of the procedure. You will be given a specific discharge time to review written home-care instructions, take-home medications and view digital images and radiographs from the procedure. </div>

         How much will it cost?
         <span class="accordion-item-arrow"></span>
      </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        The cost is determined by the time that it takes Dr Hoover and his staff to complete the procedure. In all cases, a written treatment plan and estimate will be prepared during the initial consultation. It is very important to understand that a final estimate cannot be given until completing the oral examination and review of the dental radiographs.  After a review of the medical record and/or discussion with your family veterinarian, Dr Hoover and his staff are usually able to give general cost estimates by phone prior to the consultation. </div>
